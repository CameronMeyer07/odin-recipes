As the project started I rushed into getting it over with so I could continue my 
coding journey as fast as possible.
Upon closer inspection I then saw that the project required 4 different iterations.
I quickly erased all the data that I had input and started from scratch to ensure I 
follow the guide step by step, as not to get ahead of myself.
I quickly learned a valuable lesson. Taking your time to thoroughly read through the
task at hand can help you save a lot of time.
